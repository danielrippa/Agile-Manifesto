# The Agile Development Software Manifesto

## The Agile Alliance

The meeting happened at Snowbird, Utah in February 2001.

The 17 people were 
* Kent Beck
* Mike Beedle
* Arie van Bennekum
* Alistair Cockburn
* Ward Cunningham
* Martin Fowler
* James Greening
* Jim Highmith
* Andrew Hunt
* Ron Jeffries
* Jon Kern
* Brian Marick
* Robert C. Martin
* Stephen J. Mellor
* Ken Schwaber
* Jeff Sutherland
* Dave "Pragmatic" Thomas

(If Dave A. Thomas from Object Technology International had been able to make it that week, we might have had two Dave Thomases as signatories!)

Each person there saw his own version of the meeting.
What follows in this appendix is mine (but I did pass this text in front of the others=-

The reason we met was to see whether there was anything in common between the various light methodologies:
Adaptive Software Development,
XP,
Scrum,
Crystal,
Feature-Driven Development,
Dynamic System Development Method (DSDM),
and "pragmatic programming".

Kent Beck, Ward Cunningham, Ron Jeffries, James Grenning and Robert Martin brought their views of XP,
along with their considerable other experiences and their own peronal wishes.

Martin Fowler brought long experience in box XP and methodology evaluation in general.

Jim Highsmith represented Adaptive Software Development and ideas around the emergent properties of complex, adaptive systems.

I was there, protecting my interests in methodology-per-project and just-in-time methodology construction.

Jeff Sutherland, Ken Schwaber and Michael Beedle represented Scrum.

John Kern of TpgetherSoft represented Feature-Driven Development, the method described in Java Modeling in Color with UML.

Arie van Bennekum, from the Netherlands, represented DSDM.

Andy Hunt and Dave "Pragmatic" Thomas, authors of the _Pragmatic Programmer_ protected the interests of experienced programmers who have no affiliation to any one method.

Brian Marick represented the software-testing perspective.

Stephen J. Mellor was there to protect his interests in model-driven development.
He was perhaps the most surprised to find himself able to agree with most of what was said and signed both the manifesto and the principles.

There were others who had been invited, and would certainly have contributed and signed,
but those listed are the people who were there and who argued about, crafted and signed the agreements.

We hoped against hope that we would actually agree on something.

None of us was interested in merging the practices to create a "Unified Light Method" (ULM).
Given the individualism in the room was actually surprising that we agreed on anything.

We agreed on four things:

* We agreed at the first level, on the need to respond to change. We agreed that _agile_ reflected our intent and permits discussion of heavier-agile methodologies for larger and life-critical projects.
* We agreed at the second level, on four core values as described in the manifesto.
* We agreed at the third level (just barely), on twelve more detailed statements consistent with those four values.
* It was clear that we would not agree on the fourth level, detailed project tactics. We did agree that this was healthy for the industry and that we should continue to innovate and compete in the world of ideas, to discover a larger set of agile software practices.

With those agreements and the adoption of the term _agile_, the 17 people created the Agile Alliance.

## The Manifesto

Let's look at the wording of the manifesto more closely.

> We are uncovering better ways of developing software by doing it and helping others do it.

We (the people in the group) are software development practitioners, not merely onlookers making rules for others.
We feel that we have "uncovered" practices more than invented them and want to be clear that we will continue to work by helping as well as by telling.

> Through this work we have come to value...

The ideas were not arrived at in a vacuum but rather an outcome of our direct experience and reflection on that experience.

Before listing the four choices, I'll skip ahead and look at the closing sentence:

> That is, while there is value in the items on the right, we value the items on the left more.

We are not interested in tearing down the house of software development.
We recognize that tools, processes, documentation, contractas and plans have value.
What we wish to express is that when push comes to shove (which it usually does),
somethign has to give.
We feel tht people who hang onto the right-hand choices in the list will not do
as well as people who hang onto the left-hand choices.

We also want to recognize that some people disagree with one or all of our choices.
One person said, on seeing our list: "I can agree with three of the four".
We agreed that that sort of disagreement can lead to constructive conversations.

There is no "opposite" to _agile methodology_, just as there is no opposite to "Bengal tiger".
There are alternatives to agile methodologies, phrased according to their own
value systems: _repeatable, deliberate, predictable_ even _capricious_ methodologies.

Understand, of course, that all of these denote the successful version of the practices.

Perhaps better terms are _would-be-agile_, _would-be-predictable_, and _would-be-repeatable_ development.

It is important to me, personally, to leave room for disagreements on these matters.
Our industry still disagrees about what is critical to successful software development.
The best approach for the time being is simply to say what one stands for.
Evidently, this point is important to the other signatories, too.

With that in mind, let's look at the four choices:

> **Individuals and interactions** over processes and tools

The first value is attending to the people on the team as opposed to roles in the process chart.
Although a process description is needed to get a group of people started, people are not plug-replaceable, as we have seen.

The second choice being highlighted there is attending to the interactions between the individuals.
New solutions and flaws in old solutions come to life in discussions between people.
The quality of the interaction matters.

Actually, improved community benefits process-centric development just as much as it does chaotic development.

What this first value expresses is that we would rather use an undocumented process with good interactions than a documented process with hostile interactions.

> **Working software** over comprehensive documentation.

The working system is the only thing that tells you what the team _has_ built.
Running code is ruthlessly honest.

Documents showing the requirements, analysis, design, screen flows, object interaction
sequence charts and the like are handy as hints.
The team members use them as aids in reflecting on their own experience,
to guess what the future will look like.

The documents serve as markers in the game, used to build an image of the unreliable future.

On the other hand, the composite act of gathering requirements, designing, coding and debugging the software
reveals information about the development team, the development process, and the nature of the problem to be solved.
Those things together with running final result provide the only reliable measure of the speed of the team,
the shortcomings of the group, and a glimpse into what the team really should be building.

Documents can be very useful, as we have seen, but they should be used along with the words "just enoug" and "barely sufficient".

> **Customer collaboration** over contract negotiation

The third value describes the relationship between the people who want the software built
and those who are building the software.
The distinction is that in properly formed agile development, there is no "us" and "them", there is only "us".

_Collaboration_ deals with community, amicability, joint decision making, rapidity of communication, and connections to the interactions of individuals.
Attention to customer collaboration indicates an amicable relationship (which does not preclude conflict) across specialties and organizational boundaries.
Sayint "there is only us" refers to the fact that both are needeed to produce good softare.

Although contracts are useful at times, collaboration strenghtens development both
when a contract is in place and when no contract exists.
Good collaboration can save a contract situation when it is in jeopardy.
Good collaboration can sometimes make a contract innecesary.
Either way, collaboration is the winning element.

> **Responding to change** over following a plan

The final value is about adjusting to fast-breaking project changes.

Building a plan is useful, and each of the agile methodologies contains specific
planning activities.
They also contain mechanisms for dealing with changing priorities.

Scrum, DSDM and Adaptive Software development call for timeboxed development
with reprioritization _after_ (not within) each time box (XP allows reprioritization within the timebox).
The timeboxed periods are in the two- to four-week range.
The timeboxing guarantees that the team has the time and peace of mind to develop _working software_.
The relatively short development phases, what Scrum call "sprints", allow the project sponsors to change priorities to match their needs.

Building a plan is useful. Referring to the plan is useful until it gets too far from the current situation.
Hanging onto an outdated plan is not useful.
